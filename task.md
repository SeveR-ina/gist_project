# Task

**Project Familiarization:** Please familiarize yourself with Gist functionality of GitHub. You'll need to:

- Go through the API documentation and check that you’re able to request endpoints
- Understand the functionalities and features of the web interface

**Testing Strategy:** Once you're comfortable with the API and Frontend:

1. Think about potential testing strategies you'd adopt
2. Identify possible test cases and scenarios, including edge cases
3. Consider the tools or frameworks you'd use for testing
4. Prepare a boilerplate project to write automatic tests. Preferable languages are Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python

5. Write automatic tests for creating/getting Gists. Cover only the critical functionality from your point of view

**Practical Insights:** We will discuss:

1. Your observations and thoughts about the feature
2. Recommendations on how you’d set its quality assurance process
3. Suggestions on automating the testing process, if applicable
4. Imagine that we want to add new functionality. How’d you plan the scope of work?
